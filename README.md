# Cards Against Assembly

Let's put those hard earned new skills from this week to work! We'll be using a little bit of everything we learned so far to make a real-time, data driven application with React and Firebase. 

---

## Prerequisites

* [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
* [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router)
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)

---

## Requirements

Using the [mockup](./mockup) provided, create a React application that allows a user to view all the cards saved and to create new ones as well. 

* Create a new React application from the ground up using `create-react-app`
* Use React Router to manage state 
* Use [dotenv](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#adding-custom-environment-variables) to store configuration values
* Separate the single CSS file into individual component CSS files 
* All cards should initially be face down when loaded and revealed when clicked
* Users should be able to see a preview of the card to be added before saving

## Challenges

* Deploy your React application to either [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/deploying) or [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
* Swap out Firebase with an Node/Express/MongoDB setup
